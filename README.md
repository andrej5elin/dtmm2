# dtmm2
 
DTMM2 is a temporary code from https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/125330690, modified to include second harmonic generation calculation on 1D structures using Berreman 4x4 matrix formalism.

The code hosted on this repository is meant to be a temporary code. The goal is to develop a new interface for numerical simulations on birefringent material for POM and SHG imaging. We plan to backport the code to the original *dtmm* package once the work is complete.
